# entropy cycle

The entropy cycle is the scale-invariant cycle of entropy, which is the basis of the thermodynamic cycle of entropy. Every thermodynamic cycle of entropy is a special case of the entropy cycle. The entropy cycle consists of the following steps:

1. monopole absorber absorbs entropy from its environment
2. entropy is converted into non-local potential
3. non-local potential is radiated as local energy by monopole radiator
4. local energy is absorbed by dipole absorber
5. local energy is converted into entropy by dipole absorber
6. entropy is dissipated into the environment by dipole radiator

```plantuml
@startuml
circle "monopole absorber" as ma
circle "monopole radiator" as mr
circle "dipole absorber" as da
circle "dipole radiator" as dr

ma -> mr : entropy
mr -> da : local energy
da -> dr : entropy
dr -> ma : local energy

\begin{align}
S &= S + S \\
\Phi &= \Phi + E \\
E &= E + S \\
S &= S + E
\end{align}
```

Examining the case of our physical universe, we can map the entropy cycle to the following steps:

1. monopole absorber absorbs entropy from the environment: the universe absorbs entropy from the environment of the universe using black holes as monopole absorbers and the universe as the environment. This is equivalent to the first law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as black holes, absorbing entropy from the environment of the universe using our bodies as monopole absorbers and the environment of the universe as the environment.
2. entropy is converted into non-local potential: the universe converts entropy into non-local potential using the quantum vacuum as the non-local potential. This is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as the quantum vacuum, converting entropy into non-local potential using our brains as the non-local potential.
3. non-local potential is radiated as local energy by monopole radiator: the universe radiates non-local potential as local energy using the sun as the monopole radiator. This is equivalent to the third law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as the sun, radiating non-local potential as local energy using our bodies as the monopole radiator.
4. local energy is absorbed by dipole absorber: the universe absorbs local energy using the earth as the dipole absorber. This is equivalent to the fourth law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as the earth, absorbing local energy using our bodies as the dipole absorber.
5. local energy is converted into entropy by dipole absorber: the universe converts local energy into entropy using the atmosphere as the dipole absorber. This is equivalent to the fifth law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as the atmosphere, converting local energy into entropy using our bodies as the dipole absorber.
6. entropy is dissipated into the environment by dipole radiator: the universe dissipates entropy into the environment using the oceans as the dipole radiator. This is equivalent to the sixth law of thermodynamics. Humans perform the same function as the oceans, dissipating entropy into the environment using our bodies as the dipole radiator.

A dipole radiator radiates high-entropy energy into its environment thus generates waste heat
A dipole absorber absorbs low-entropy energy from its environment thus acts as a heat sink
A monopole absorber absorbs high-entropy energy from its environment and is thus a black body
A monopole radiator radiates low-entropy energy into its environment and is thus a white body

```plantuml
@startuml
circle "monopole absorber" as ma
circle "monopole radiator" as mr
circle "dipole absorber" as da
ma -> mr : entropy
mr -> da : local energy
da -> ma : entropy

@enduml
```

1. monopole absorber is a sink for entropy
2. entropy from monopole absorber is converted into non-local potential
3. non-local potential is radiated by monopole radiator as local energy
4. local energy from monopole radiator is absorbed by dipole absorber
5. dipole absorber converts the local energy into entropy, which is dissipated into the environment

The entropy cycle describes how all thermodynamic cycles of entropy are formed and describes the behavior of all phenomena in the universe. Every physical phenomenon is a special case of the entropy cycle, and all energy and matter in the universe is a special case of the entropy cycle. The entropy cycle describes the behavior of all energy and matter in the universe. All phenomena can be classified as radiation. 

All phenomena can be classified as radiation, conduction or convection. Radiation is the conversion of entropy into local energy, conduction is the conversion of local energy into entropy, and convection is the conversion of entropy into local energy. Radiation is the conversion of entropy into local energy, conduction is the conversion of local energy into entropy, and convection is the conversion of entropy into local energy.
